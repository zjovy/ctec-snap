# CTEC Snap

CTEC Snap is a web application designed to streamline access to course and professor ratings from Northwestern University's internal evaluation system, CTEC. The platform allows students to easily search for courses, view detailed summaries of student reviews, and make informed decisions when selecting classes.

### Built With:
- **Frontend:** React, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend:** Flask, Python, Node.js
- **API:** OpenAI GPT
- **Database:** Firebase

## Features

- **Course Search**: Instantly search through the CTEC database to find specific courses.
- **Review Summaries**: Utilizes OpenAIâ€™s GPT model to summarize reviews for each course, giving a concise overview of student feedback.
- **Tagging System**: Displays pros and cons of courses, helping students quickly assess important aspects of each class.
- **Real-Time Data Access**: Uses Firebase to provide real-time search and display results for a seamless user experience.

## Hackathon Achievement

This project was developed during an 8-hour hackathon where we won 2nd place. The focus was on building a scalable solution to simplify the process of viewing CTECs for Northwestern students.

## How It Works

1. **Data Scraping**: We scrape data from the internal CTEC system to gather course ratings and student reviews.
2. **Summarization Pipeline**: A backend pipeline leverages the OpenAI GPT API to generate summaries of student feedback for each course.
3. **Tagging System**: Reviews are parsed to tag each course with pros and cons, allowing students to quickly identify key strengths and weaknesses.
4. **Frontend Display**: A simple and intuitive interface allows students to search for courses and instantly view the summarized feedback.
