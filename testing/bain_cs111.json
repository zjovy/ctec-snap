{"Responses": ["This course was a fun course with interesting activities, it just needs to be taught in python or C instead of racket.", "CS 111 is a good introductory CS course overall. I had some coding experience from AP CSA in high school and thought the course was not bad at all. However, I believe that I found the course to not be that bad because of my previous programming experience, and using Racket (which is the language used in 111) as a first\u2013time coder would be hard because of the language's syntax. Q2 was definitely the most difficult quiz, as it covers topics like recursion and binary trees, but besides that the quizzes are not bad.", "This class is a great intro class for anyone who's interested in learning the foundations for any programming language/more advanced CS topics beyond Racket. Connor Bain is a great prof, and you can tell he's genuinely engaged with the material and wants the students to have fun learning. However, the only drawback was that the pacing was a little skewed \u2013 the course started off relatively easy\u2013going but really ramped up after week 2, so complete beginners to CS might have some trouble adjusting.", "I thought this class was going to be an easy A, but I ended with a B+. I was surprised to get a 54% on the last quiz which was worth 13.3% of my grade, and the answers were not posted afterwards, nor the info about the mean and median scores. The workload for this class is definitely manageable, but there weren't many good resources for preparing for assessments compared to my other classes. Sometimes Professor Bain's slideshows felt too advanced, using words whose definitions had not been established previously in the class.", "I thought that this course was overall pretty good. The homework was mostly manageable, except the snake game they have you do is actually pretty difficult. I wish they gave more material to practice with though.", "I think Bain is a great teacher, and this would be a great class for someone with little coding experience. However, it is pretty frustrating for someone with experience, because it is designed to start from the very basics. Racket is also pretty annoying and unlike 'real' coding languages, and definitely took some getting used to. However, the grading is very forgiving, so this class is an easy A.", "pros \u2013 Highly recommend Prof Bain though, as he makes the classes funny and engaging. I'm one for dorky nerdy jokes and this class was full of it. Good slides and variety in his teaching methods. Grading for quizzes is lenient, and tutorials, mini quizzes and exercises are fairly easy to score in as long as you attend class. 10/10 prof", "cons \u2013 Racket is a pretty annoying language to learn if you have programming experience with other more mainstream languages. It gets confusing real quick when functions get longer.", "The course was definitely challenging especially due to the obscurity of Dr.Racket as a language, but Professor Bain did a great job of teaching the class overall.", "While Racket is not really used that much the course content was still helpful nonetheless. It taught me the fundamentals of how to code and debug code and also I appreciated that we were encouraged to ask for help from peers and get feedback on our code.", "Great class. Connor Bain is an excellent teacher. You learn a lot and the class is very easy overall.", "Having significant prior coding experience, I found this class to be very easy. The instruction is not bad. This course is taught in a coding language called Dr. Racket which has extremely unique (in a bad way) syntax which makes coding a headache. Presumably, this is done to level the playing field between people who are new to coding and people who have prior experience, though I did not find this to be the case personally \u2013 the use of Dr. Racket just makes everything more confusing for everyone.", "Only take this class if you need to \u2013 if you are just looking to learn CS because you want some knowledge in this technology dominated world, learn python and take CS 110.", "Good review of the ideas relevant to learning & understanding how to program. Racket syntax was a bit challenging at times, but prior coding experience should make this an easy A. From what I've heard, not having prior experience makes this class a bit difficult, but still manageable\u2014overall, a nice intro to CS.", "Prof. Bain is simply an icon. A lot of people don't like this class because it's taught in Racket, but as someone who had no programming experience coming in, I didn't have any issues with it. Lectures are organized and you don't have to take notes because the slides are always posted. The professor is super well\u2013spoken, and considering how big the class is, I felt pretty engaged most of the time. Exercises sometimes took a while to figure out but were very helpful for putting class material into practice.", "Overall, the course is sufficient in teaching the basics of how to code, but the quizzes are hard to do well on, because it's so easy to make mistakes.", "I thought racket was a little bit weird, and the programming was definitely a lot different than other programming experience I've had. However, I think definitely with some work it can definitely all make sense.", "Really chill class, lots of accommodation present if you're ever sick or can't make it to a class but in a way that prevents you from falling behind. Had fun with some of the assignments and nothing was ever unreasonably difficult.", "The aspect that was most important to me was recursion. I appreciated the strong emphasis on this topic and the substitution model that was used to represent how recursion works.", "The professor is great. It is obvious he really likes teaching and cs, and you can see all the effort that was put into all the course materials. There is a lot of academic support available: from office hours to Ed discussions. I didn't have any coding experience before this course, and I found it very manageable. There is a lot of practice built in in the course schedule (exercises + tutorials), which makes it easier to learn the material and makes the course more fun. Except the four main quizzes...", "THIS CTEC IS FOR STUDENTS WHO ARE CONSIDERING THIS COURSE WITH LITTLE TO NO KNOWLEDGE OF CODING: This course gives a lot of padding to your grade. Most of the grades you get are given based on completion as long as you are in attendance of class. You also complete one exercise a week which can be intellectually challenging, but most people always receive full points. Many people say this is an easy class, and yes, this class has enough padding that as long as you do the work (which is minimal), you will pass the class.", "Most of the teaching was through slides which I thought wasn't very effective for me. Make sure to try problems in Racket yourself to get how everything works. Utilize tutorial time and edSTEM \u2013 it was super helpful in understanding the concepts and made the homework assignments less frustrating.", "the course is very doable and catering towards beginners.", "this is a very difficult class if you are new to coding. I thought I would be fine because I have a strong STEM/math background, but I had a really hard time. Connor is great though and he did a lot to help me succeed. Definitely go to office hours, definitely go to the review sessions, definitely work with your friends on the exercises. Not an easy A, but definitely not impossible. If you're nervous and deciding between 110 and 111, I would go with 110.", "The pace of the course is a bit surprisingly quick to me (as a person who knew literally nothing about Python and Racket), and we were already talking about recursions in the second unit of the course. And many people in this class do come in with abundant experiences in coding. The exams are pretty straightforward, and the exercises are reasonably challenging. I personally believe that this course will be quite difficult for a person without much experience with coding.", "Not too bad. Dr. Racket's annoying but Bain's a cool guy and the course is nothing you can't handle.", "My only gripe with this class is that the class tries to accommodate for a wide skill range. People with 2\u20133 years of coding experience are required to take this class while people with no coding experience are also required to take this class."]}
